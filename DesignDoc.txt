NEW INSTRUCTIONS (4/4/11):

Create an account at goodreads-thing.heroku.com/register
Login at ~/login

During registration, may select admin or user account

Administrators: Can create questions/questionnaires, assign questionnaires,
and view submitted responses.

Users: Can only respond to questionnaires they have been assigned, and
respond/submit their answers.

Notes:

-Questions must be created prior to including them in a questionnaire.
-Questions, once created, cannot be edited (only deleted).

Future improvements:

-Add a comment model, for administrators to comment on applicants.
-Add a new table to allow assignment before user account has been created.
    This table can be parsed after each user account has been created, to allow
    admins to assign questionnaires to e-mail addresses not already in the system.
-E-mail notification for assignment/submission
-Dynamic questionnaire creation/editing
-Improve aesthetics

Known issues:

-App not account for modification of questionnaires that have already been taken.

OLD INSTRUCTIONS (3/28/11):

-Admin login-
email: admin@admin.com
pass: admin

-eric login-
email: eric@eric.com
pass: eric

Admin and user accounts (i.e. eric) are handled differently. Namely, admin
can create new questions/questionnaires, and users can only view the questionnaires
that have been assigned to them.

Known issues:

-Questionnaire creation/modification is broken
-Creating/Updating questions results in a double notification
-Assigning questionnaires to users does not work
-No protection against duplication for entries in question database
-No way to set admin status (other than through activemodel)
-Users are unable to respond to questionnaires (can only view)

Design notes:

Users log in. If the user doesn't have a login, they must register first. After
logging in, they will have different options, depending on their account type.

--ADMIN--

If a user is flagged as Admin, they are taken to a listing of all questionnaires.

Here, they can create new question(naire)s, modify/delete existing
question(naire)s, and also assign questionnaires.

They should also be able to access a page listing all of the questionnaires that
they assigned, sorted by submit time and completion status.

When creating a new questionnaire, the user will be taken to a form, where 
they can draw from the pool of existing questions. Additionally, they can add
questions that don't exist, by typing them out. If the user adds questions
using this option, and types out a question, it should be checked against
existing questions, so the same question doesn't end up existing twice in the DB.

When assigning a questionnaire to users, a mailer should send a user an e-mail, 
containing the URL of the quiz. Ideally, this should save the quiz for the user, 
for when they create their account.

On the admin side, when clicking on the assignment link, they should be taken to a 
form with a list of all users who have not had that questionnaire assigned 
(populated by searching assignment table). The user should be able to assign the questionnaire 
to multiple users using this form.

--USERS--

After logging in, users are taken to a page showing questionnaires they
have been assigned, also showing who it has been assigned by.

Clicking on each questionnaire takes the user to that questionnaire,
which they can take.

On the user's 'home page', they should also see a history of their most recently 
submitted questionnaires.

While taking a questionnaire, users should be able to save their progress, to come
back to it later.

Submitting a questionnaire will finalize their answers, and notify the person
who assigned the questionnaire that it has been completed (also with a URL to the 
user's responses). Ideally, this will be done via a mailer.
